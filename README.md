# quarto-inrae-brand

The goal of this extension is to provide a simple and easy way of producing documents, slides and websites using our institute's brand guidelines, using the new `brand.yml` feature introduced in quarto 1.6

This is a newer and cleaner version of the `quarto-inrae-extension` template.

# Prerequisites

- Quarto **>= 1.6**

# Installing in a new project

You will need to do this to get all the folders with all the templates, assets and prefilled quarto templates :

```bash
quarto use template davidcarayon/quarto-inrae-brand
```

# Installing for an existing project

You may also use this format with an existing project to download only the `_extensions` folder (**not recommended because you won't have the preconfigured qmd files**).

```bash
quarto add davidcarayon/quarto-inrae-brand
```

# How to use it

Work In Progress
